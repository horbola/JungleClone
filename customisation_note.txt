* To change stall name:
    1) go to this file - ****views/page/reports/tracking-id-panel.jade****
    2) note some lines like this - li #[span.rect-out #[span.rect-fill]] All
    3) the last word after the closing bracket in each line is the stall name.
    4) here, that is 'All'. change this to the name you desire.
       example: li #[span.rect-out #[span.rect-fill]] New Name
    5) note: you can not change any name which are the folder name located
       here- ****views/lib/js/chart/data or anywhere else inside the code****
       so you have to keep track of which folder represents which name in
       the HTML(jade) page mentioned in step 1.
    6) suggestion: maintain a list of - [stall id : folder name : custom name].
       example follows below (do not edit this example, rather, maintain a separate file) -
       
       stall id         folder name     custom name

* To change data:
    1) Note 1: you enter data month-wise. from those month data, data for each day
       will be automatically generated. each stall contains data for 12 months. this
       12 month's data will be shown for each new year mimicking the original data in a
       real case, dates and year will be updated automatically.

    2) Note 2: there is a file for each month containing the data you will enter. that
       file is named after the month name for which data needs to be generated. for
       example, if original data is situated in a file named 'jan.js' then the file name in
       which you will enter your data would be 'jan-config.js'. all 12 month's configuration data
       for a stall are contained in a folder named after that stall. and all stall folders
       are contained within this root folder:- ****js/control/data-generator/data-config****.
       Original data which are used by the chart and are generated automatically from your entered
       'config data' are located in this folder: ****views/lib/js/chart/data****
       
    3) open any configuration file in any stall, such as jan-config.js in 5cyclingnew-20.
       (path: ****js/control/data-generator/data-config/5cyclingnew-20/jan-config.js****)

    4) note these data types: clicks, ordered_items, sell_earnings, commissions, bounties, referrals
                              referral_earnings, shipped, returned, shippedRev, bonus.
       each of these data type has four configuration options: dataType, gross, diviation and breakPoints.
       change only the 'gross' option on yourself and change other options in an advance case or
       with the help of your developer firm.
       (here sell_earnings and commissions are same. so put the same number in both types.)
       (bounties and referral_earnings are same. don't put any number in referral_earnings)

    5) change the value of 'gross' option as you want for each type necessary for you. for example,
       in 'jan-config.js', change 'gross: 50091' of 'clicks' to 'gross: 70000'. restart your nodejs app
       in your server.

    6) after changing in all files you needed, bring the page in a browser mentioned below.
       page link: **** https://affiliate-program-amz.com/admin/update-data ****
       click on the 'Update Data' button and restart your nodejs app in your server.

    7) go to app edit page in your server. find and click on '|> Run js script' button. select 'build'
       from the popup window if it's not selected. click on '|> RUN JS SCRIPT' button on the same popup
       window. wait to finish and restart your nodejs app in your server.
    
    8) Note 3: you are restarting the server actually 3 times for each change in your configuration file.
       this is the restarting order: a- after changing in any configuration file
                                     b- after pressing the update button
                                     c- after pressing (second time) the '|> RUN JS SCRIPT' button




* To change user id and password:
    1) open ****routes/index.js**** file
    2) find this line: 'if(emailStr === 'iqbalhossain9069@gmail.com' && passwordStr === '123Saiza@@@'){'
       may be on line number 19.
    3) change the email address from 'iqbalhossain9069@gmail.com' to the address you want and
       change the password from '123Saiza@@@' to the password you want
